v1.1
Added a way to separate window effects from modals. Separated Open and Close effects from Minimize/Unminimize effects. Started working on a new config UI.


v1.0
This is a first stable release. Changed the name from kwinDevEffect (that supposed to be changed right from the start) to Animations Suite.
Restructured the code, added more effects. Added a way to use the same animations for minimizing and maximizing windows and popups. Added the GUI to edit effects and change the duration.

v0.4
Fixed the issue with the non-working effects that use the window height or width. Added the opacity effect. Added the opacity sub-effect to all effects. Now, the animations should work better and with less artifacts. Added the config file placeholders.

v0.3
Moved the effect data into the objects and arrays. 
Added the variables where you can specify the desired effects for the open and close animation as well as the animation duration. Added the Readme and changelog files.


v0.2
Added the effect patterns in the comments. To use an effect you need to uncomment it.


v0.1
Reverse engineered the effect patterns. A custom effect is working.
